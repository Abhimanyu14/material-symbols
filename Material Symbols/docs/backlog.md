# Architectural Improvement Suggestions

## Overall Architecture

*   **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) and Dependency Injection (DI):** Inject dependencies (e.g., `IconDataSource` into `MaterialSymbolsRepositoryImpl`, `IconFetcher` into `IconDataSourceImpl`, `IconParser` into `IconFetcherImpl`) into constructors rather than direct instantiation. This enhances testability, modularity, and flexibility.

## Repository Layer (`MaterialSymbolsRepositoryImpl`)

*   **Separation of Concerns - URL Construction and File Naming:** Extract URL construction (`createIconUrl`, `getFileUrl`) and file naming (`getFileName`) logic into a dedicated utility class (e.g., `MaterialSymbolUrlBuilder`). This makes the repository more focused on data access.
*   **Caching Strategy:** Consider a more robust caching solution (e.g., LRU cache, disk cache) for `drawableResourceFileContentCache` and `iconUrlCache` if persistence or larger scale is needed. Implement a clear cache invalidation strategy.
*   **Error Handling:** Add robust error handling (e.g., `try-catch`, `Result` types) to `fetchDrawableResourceFileContent` for network operations to gracefully manage failures.
*   **Constants and Configuration:** Move default values (e.g., `DEFAULT_FILLED`) to a dedicated configuration object or `Constants` file if they are configurable or used across modules.
*   **Immutability:** Where possible, make `allIcons` and `allMaterialSymbols` `val` and initialize them once, or use immutable data structures for updates.

## Network Layer (`IconDataSourceImpl`, `IconFetcherImpl`)

*   **Network Abstraction:** Leverage a modern network library (like Retrofit, given OkHttp is already present) to define API interfaces, simplifying network requests and error handling.
*   **Explicit Error Handling:** Use Kotlin's `Result` type to explicitly represent success or failure, improving error handling clarity.
*   **Configuration:** Externalize hardcoded URLs into a configuration file or `Constants` object for better maintainability.
*   **Coroutine Usage:** Prefer `withContext` and `async/await` with a proper network library over manual `suspendCoroutine` for cleaner asynchronous code.
*   **Robust Caching:** Ensure the caching mechanism in `IconFetcherImpl` is robust, handles invalidation, and is well-documented, potentially using a dedicated caching solution for persistence.
*   **Centralized OkHttpClient:** Create a single, reusable `OkHttpClient` instance rather than instantiating it per `fetchIconData` call for performance and resource management.
*   **Coroutine-based Asynchronous Operations:** Refactor the `OkHttpClient.enqueue` callback into a suspend function using `suspendCancellableCoroutine` for more idiomatic and readable asynchronous Kotlin code.
*   **Robust Error Handling and Response Parsing:**
    *   Explicitly check `response.isSuccessful` and propagate network errors via `onFetchFailure`.
    *   Improve handling of `response.body` to prevent `null` issues.
    *   Consider direct use of `kotlinx.serialization` for structured response parsing.
